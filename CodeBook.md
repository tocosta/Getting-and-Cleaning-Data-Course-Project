## The data

The dataset includes the following files:

File name             | Description
----------------------|------------
'README.txt'          |
'features_info.txt'   | Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
'features.txt'        | List of all features
'activity_labels.txt' | Links the class labels with their activity name
'train/X_train.txt'   | Training set
'train/y_train.txt'   | Training labels
'test/X_test.txt'     | Test set
'test/y_test.txt'     | Test labels

## Variable list and descriptions

Variable name    | Description
-----------------|------------
subject          | ID the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.

featVariable     | Feature: Variable (Mean or SD)
featJerk         | Feature: Jerk signal
featMagnitude    | Feature: Magnitude of the signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
featAxis         | Feature: 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions (X, Y, or Z)
featCount        | Feature: Count of data points used to compute `average`
featAverage      | Feature: Average of each variable for each activity and each subject
