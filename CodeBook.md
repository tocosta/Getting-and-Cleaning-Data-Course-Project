This is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data.

Codebook was generated on 2014-07-27 01:38:12 during the same process that generated the dataset. 

## Data Source

This dataset is derived from the "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set" which was originally made avaiable here: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones
* Original data: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## The data

The dataset includes the following files:

File Name             | Description
----------------------|------------
'README.txt'          |
'features_info.txt'   | Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector
'features.txt'        | List of all features
'activity_labels.txt' | Links the class labels with their activity name
'train/X_train.txt'   | Training set
'train/y_train.txt'   | Training labels
'test/X_test.txt'     | Test set
'test/y_test.txt'     | Test labels
'train/subject_train.txt' | Each row identifies the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30
'train/Inertial Signals/total_acc_x_train.txt' | The acceleration signal from the smartphone accelerometer X axis in standard gravity units 'g'. Every row shows a 128 element vector. The same description applies for the 'total_acc_x_train.txt' and 'total_acc_z_train.txt' files for the Y and Z axis
'train/Inertial Signals/body_acc_x_train.txt' | The body acceleration signal obtained by subtracting the gravity from the total acceleration.
'train/Inertial Signals/body_gyro_x_train.txt' | The angular velocity vector measured by the gyroscope for each window sample. The units are radians/second.

## Transformation Details

There are 5 parts:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names.
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

* The result is saved as "./tidy-UCI-HAR-AVG-dataset.csv", a 180x68 data frame (181 with column name), where as before, the first column contains subject IDs, the second column contains activity names (see below), and then the averages for each of the 66 attributes are in columns 3...68. There are 30 subjects and 6 activities, thus 180 rows in this data set with averages`

## How ```run_analysis.R``` implements the above steps:

* Checks if the file exists, otherwise it downloads. 
* Checks if the file has already been extracted to the directory.
* Load both test and train data.
* Load the features and activity labels.
* Extract the mean and standard deviation column names and data.
* Process the data. 
* Merge and creates data set



## Variable list and Descriptions

Variable name    | Description
-----------------|------------
subject          | ID the subject who performed the activity for each window sample. Its range is from 1 to 30.
activity         | Activity name
featDomain       | Feature: Time domain signal or frequency domain signal (Time or Freq)
featInstrument   | Feature: Measuring instrument (Accelerometer or Gyroscope)
featAcceleration | Feature: Acceleration signal (Body or Gravity)
featVariable     | Feature: Variable (Mean or SD)
featJerk         | Feature: Jerk signal
featMagnitude    | Feature: Magnitude of the signals calculated using the Euclidean norm
featAxis         | Feature: 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions (X, Y, or Z)
featCount        | Feature: Count of data points used to compute `average`
featAverage      | Feature: Average of each variable for each activity and each subject
